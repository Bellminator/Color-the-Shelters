		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			There can be no thought of finishing for aiming for the stars. Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
			<br>
			I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine
			<br>
			The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!
			<br>
			That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.
			<br>
			Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
