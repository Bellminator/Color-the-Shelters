				There can be no thought of finishing for aiming for the stars. Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

				I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

				The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!

				Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
